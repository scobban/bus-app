# BusUs - MBTA bus-tracking app
BusUs is a javascript-based app for tracking the arrival times of the MBTA buses in Boston, MA. [Try it live at http://busus.us](http://busus.us).

## About
I took the Javascript Remote course offered by General Assembly from May to July 2017. This is my final project from that class. The requirements for the project were to make _something_ that made use of techniques that we learned in this introductory Javasript course.

## Why
I had a iOS app for tracking the buses. One day, iOS told me that the app hadn't been updated and was negatively affecting the performance of my phone. I knew I had to take things into my own hands!

After we learned how to work with AJAX in class, I found the NextBus public XML feed of all of the MBTA bus information I needed to make my own bus tracking app website.

I had the information. I had the skills. And now I have the (basic version of the) app.
